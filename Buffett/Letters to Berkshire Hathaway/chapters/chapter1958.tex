    \noindent A friend who runs a medium-sized investment trust recently wrote:
    `The mercurial temperament, characteristic of the American people, produced
    a major transformation in 1958 and ‘exuberant’ would be the proper word
    for the stock market, at least''.

    一位掌管中等规模投资信托的朋友最近写到：“美国人善变的气质，导致了 1958 年市
    场的转变，繁荣这个词用来形容股市应该恰如其分。”

\begin{verseparallel}
  {
    I think this summarizes the change in psychology dominating the stock market in 1958 at both the amateur and
    professional levels. During the past year almost any reason has been seized upon to justify “Investing” in the
    market. There are undoubtedly more mercurially-tempered people in the stock market now than for a good many
    years and the duration of their stay will be limited to how long they think profits can be made quickly and
    effortlessly. While it is impossible to determine how long they will continue to add numbers to their ranks and
    thereby stimulate rising prices, I believe it is valid to say that the longer their visit, the greater the reaction from
    it.
