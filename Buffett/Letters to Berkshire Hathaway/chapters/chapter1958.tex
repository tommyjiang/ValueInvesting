    \noindent A friend who runs a medium-sized investment trust recently wrote:
    `The mercurial temperament, characteristic of the American people, produced
    a major transformation in 1958 and `exuberant' would be the proper word
    for the stock market, at least''. \\

    一位掌管中等规模投资信托的朋友最近写到：“美国人善变的性格，导致了 1958 年市
    场的转变，繁荣这个词用来形容股市应该恰如其分。”

    I think this summarizes the change in psychology dominating the stock market
    in 1958 at both the amateur and professional levels. During the past year
    almost any reason has been seized upon to justify “Investing” in the
    market. There are undoubtedly more mercurially-tempered people in the stock
    market now than for a good many years and the duration of their stay will be
    limited to how long they think profits can be made quickly and effortlessly.
    While it is impossible to determine how long they will continue to add
    numbers to their ranks and thereby stimulate rising prices, I believe it is
    valid to say that the longer their visit, the greater the reaction from it. \\

    我想上面的说法总结了业余投资者和专业投资者，在 1958 年的心理变化，这种变化也
    主宰了 1958 年股票市场的表现。去年里几乎所有理由都被用于论证你应该投身股市进
    行投资。毫无疑问，现在市场上善变的人比之前一段时间更多，他们在股市中待多久，
    取决于他们觉得这样容易挣快钱的机会还能持续多久。尽管无法确定他们还会增加多少
    头寸，进一步推高股价，但他们在股市中待的时间越长，股市受影响的程度也越高。

    I make no attempt to forecast the general market --- my efforts are devoted
    to finding undervalued securities. However, I do believe that widespread
    public belief in the inevitability of profits from investment in stocks will
    lead to eventual trouble. Should this occur, prices, but not intrinsic
    values in my opinion, of even undervalued securities can be expected to be
    substantially affected. \\

      “Our performance, relatively, is likely to be better in a bear market
      than in a bull market so that deductions made from the above results
      should be tempered by the fact that it was the type of year when we should
      have done relatively will. In a year when the general market had a
      substantial advance, I would be well satisfied to match the advance of the
      averages.” \\

      我们基金在熊市中相对大盘的表现，会比牛市中更好。从上面的说法可以推断，1957
      年我们的表现好于大盘，因为 1957 年大盘是熊市。如果大盘出现明显上涨，我希望
      我们基金的涨幅都够跟上大盘，这样我就会比较满意。
