    \noindent Mark Twain said that there are two times in a man's life when he
    should not speculate: when he can't afford it and when he can. Because this
    is so, understanding the difference between investment and speculation is
    the first step in achieving investment success. \\

    To investors stocks represent fractional ownership of underlying businesses
    and bonds are loans to those businesses. Investors make buy and sell
    decisions on the basis of the current prices of securities compared with the
    perceived values of those securities. They transact when they think they
    know something that others don't know, don't care about, or prefer to
    ignore. They buy securities that appear to offer attractive return for the
    risk incurred and sell when the return no longer justifies the risk. \\
